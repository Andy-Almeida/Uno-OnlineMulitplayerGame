Folder/File Descriptions:
	/backend:
		/db: IMPORTANT contains the javascript that deals with the sql queries and functions that the routes use
			/chat.js: create - query to insert into chat db
			/connection.js: nothingyet
			/games.js: list - gets the list of games...
				   create - creates a game in the db with default values - returns the game id
				   creatingUser - get the creating user from a game
				   join - gets the highest table order from the game, and inserts a user into game_user with +1 table order
				   getUsers - gets the id and username from the game_users that match the game
		  	/users.js: create - inserts a user into the user table
		  		   findByEmail - self explanitory

		/middleware: holds middleware
			/add-session-locals.js: addSessionLocals - makes the app.locals.user = session.user
			/is-authenticated.js: isAuthenticated - gets the user from the session, 
								if the user is undefined or user id is undefined, then continue, 
								if not, redirect to login
			/request-time.js: Sends the Request recieved at Datetime to console

		/routes/static:
			/authentication.js: has routes for registration and login pages, deals heavily with account authentication
			/chat.js: has a function to emit a chat message event that works with the socket
			/games.js: functions that deal with the game webpage creation (create, join) and functionality (draw, )
			/home.js: single function to route the html with a simple html injection
			/lobby.js: single function to route the html with a simple html injection and awaits the games list
			/test.js: test page to test html injections
		
		/static: contains the bundle that the website uses. this is constructed after?? no real need to mess with...
			/scripts: contains the bundle, big and scary, dont mess with...
			/stylesheets: contains css for the page
			/favicon.ico: the pages icon
		
		/views: the base html that is called by the routes
			/games.ejs: html - hold the games, includes templates for js calls= (templates: user, card, chatmessage)
			/home.ejs: base page with all links
			/lobby.ejs: has a space for chat and the list of games that are available to join (templates: chat)
			/login.ejs: login form to log in
			/register.ejs: registration form to register

		/server.js: The main routing for the server. Would not really mess with unless you make more pages...
	
	/constants: holds a file that contains constants for the whole project
		/events.js: so far, contains two constants for events: playerjoined and gamestateupdated

	/frontend: frontend
		/css: css for the website
			/index.css: css for the website
		
		/games: js that is actually called by the html
			/index.js: js that is called by the html
		
		/util: small utilities for the html
			/game-ids.js: returns the gameId

		/index.js: js that is called by the html

	/migrations: the code the handles the Postgres database. It creates the tables. Refer to the database build above

	/node_modules: the modules that the project uses. Use npm to deal with this

	/.env: contains the connection to the database. this must be created whenever a fresh pull from github is made

	the rest of the files will either not be messed with for this project, or do not require explination

Project Interaction/Construction Flow:
	The purpose for this is to better visualise the flow of how the whole project is dealing with these cases; 
	This can hopefully help make more sense of how the project interacts with itself, and in turn make developing to it easier/make more sense
	
	Case: Index Page Requested
		1. Server.js routes the user to start at the routes/static/home.js
		2. routes/static/home.js gets the requested route and renders the home.ejs with dynamically inserted data via js
	
	Case: User uses Register page to register to site

	Case: User enters something into chat and clicks enter

	Case: User creates a game

	Case: User joins a game

Quick Notes:
	Get vs Post: Get is done when the route is requested. Post is done after the page is already loaded, and you are leaving it.
